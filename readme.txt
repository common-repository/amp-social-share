Lightweight plugin to add social sharing buttons to the AMP plugin by Automattic.

Plugin uses the AMP footer hook to add Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Email and Whatsapp sharing icons to your AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) posts. Menu tab allows for basic customizations: add a title, select share buttons, Facebook app ID and Whatsapp prefix.

This plugin is actively maintained but will not be supported. I will however try to answer any questions in the comment section of the [plugin website](https://jaaadesign.nl/en/blog/amp-social-share-plugin//) and create a FAQ here in the repository.

1. Upload en activate the plugin
2. Select share buttons
2. Copy/paste your Facebook app ID in the plugin menu tab
3. Optional: add a title and/or a Whatsapp prefix
